    <div class="about-content">
        <p>With over 15 years of experience in software development, I have worked as a Tech Lead and consultant for many important clients with various technologies and often with a strong focus on performance. I have led teams in building products remotely as well as giving workshops and training.</p>
        
        <p>I am a Principal Technical Program Manager at Microsoft, Google Developer Expert in web technologies, Nuxt Ambassador, and am a former Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in developer technologies, Media Developer Expert and GitHub star alumni.</p>
        
        <p>I have a special love for JavaScript frameworks especially Vue.js and Nuxt.js and am now focused on testing especially end to end testing with Playwright. I have a Frontend and FullStack Tech Degree and am Microsoft certified. I am an international speaker, and have spoken at many meet-ups and conferences worldwide on many continents including Antarctica.</p>
        
        <p>I am passionate about web development, testing, performance optimization, and sharing knowledge with the developer community. When I'm not writing code and studying new technologies, you can find me doing all sorts of activities from running, cycling and skiing, body combat and of course martial arts as I am a 4th degree black belt.</p>
